# mirpm

*This repository only hosts general information about mirpm (see the Wiki) and Projects to keep as a todo list. Please see the [Getting Started](#tbc) guide for getting mirpm to work on your system.*

Robotics platform for meshed devices. Provides standard communication via serial and aims to provide many methods of wireless communication. Currently working on ESP8266 support.

## Usage

See the [Getting Started](wiki/getting-started) guide.

## How can I contribute?

**I would refrain from making non-trivial contributions (as in pull requests, issues are fine) at this current stage of mirpm since the main framework has been developed. A stable version is currently far from release.**

However, if you are still interested in how mirpm works you may want to read more about the [architecture](wiki/architecture) of mirpm.

### Filing an issue

Due to the modularity of mirpm, not all issues relate to the same program and because of this, issues have to be split up. However, here's a rough list of some of the types of issues you may encounter:

#### Client issues

To identify a client issue, you will most likely see an error displayed on your client system (computer) though the command line interface. Execute the file in the terminal and copy the output. You will want to write the issue to [qt-client](/mirpm/qt-client) or whatever client you are using. Remember to make sure that you mention the exact steps needed to reproduce this issue.
